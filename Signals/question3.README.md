By default, Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller. This means that if an error occurs in the signal handler and raises an exception, it will roll back the entire transaction, including the caller's changes.

To demonstrate this, we can use a post_save signal to raise an exception after the main transaction completes. If Django signals were not in the same transaction as the caller, raising an exception in the signal handler would not affect the main transaction. However, if they are in the same transaction, the entire transaction will be rolled back, including the user creation.

### Code Example to Prove Django Signals are Synchronous

```python
from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

# Define a signal receiver that raises an exception
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_saved_signal(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received, raising exception to test transaction rollback.")
    raise Exception("Intentional exception to trigger rollback")

# Function to test if the transaction is rolled back
def test_transaction_rollback():
    try:
        with transaction.atomic():
            print("Attempting to save user...")
            user = User.objects.create(username="testuser")
            print("User saved successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception caught:", e)

    # Check if the user exists in the database after exception
    user_exists = User.objects.filter(username="testuser").exists()
    print("User exists in database after exception:", user_exists)

# Run the test
test_transaction_rollback()

```


### Expected Output

When running `test_signal_synchrony()`, the output should be:

```
Attempting to save user...
User saved successfully.
Signal received, raising exception to test transaction rollback.
Exception caught: Intentional exception to trigger rollback
User exists in database after exception: False


```
